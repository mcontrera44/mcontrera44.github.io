           I woke up super early at around 6 am to eat breakfast because I knew I need as much energy in my body as possible because I was going to be testing. While I was testing the test was easier than I expected but it was super long and when I finished I ended up falling asleep on my desk.

          <p class="oblique"> It's 6 pm and for some reason my navigation bars haven't been working I've looked over my css and code but I still can't seem to find out what's wrong with it. It is now currently 7 PM and I've found out the problem with my navigation bars. For some reason I figured out that my other css has been interfering with the navigation bar css so I started my travel page and index page over to make sure I had my navigation bar working correctly.
