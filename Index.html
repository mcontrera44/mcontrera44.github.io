	<h2> Why a Wolf is My Spirit Animal. </h2> 
	 <font color="white">
	<p> A wolf is my spirit animal because I'm a ferocious beast. I also like to be with
	a crew. I am also the leader of my crew/pack of wolves/friends :0. A wolf is known for 
	its instincts and I, Dylan, trust in my instincts. If you ask my friends what my best
	personality feature is, they would say its my spirit, I have the spirit of a wolf :)
